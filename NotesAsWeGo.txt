>>  Issue caused due to forgetting to render SDL_CreateRenderer()

>> Properly use wrapper class

>> Put grenderer inside of the game class i guess

>>IF we put grenderer inside of the game class then we wont be able to use it on texture class
>> + making a renderer in a textureClass will be a waste of resources as every object would have its own renderer, 
>>Needs a solution which utilizes reusability

>>Renderer being invalid (resolved: fix; had accidentally called the render function before creating renderer!)

>>Need to add SDL Rect as data member in texture class (done)

>>Have to deal with threads,processes and mutex for loading screens so we do it simply and manually in three chunks

>>Went savage on the loading screen, clean up as OOP later on

>>Delayed the welcome text until later on (yet to be resolved)

>>Use clip to resize the welcome logo with accordance to the screensize, out of proportion atm()
